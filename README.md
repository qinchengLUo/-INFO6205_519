Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a computational model that simulates the natural evolution of Darwin's biological evolution theory and the biological evolution process of genetics. It is commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspire operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.


Suppose there is a two-dimensional array space. Our goal is to reach the point in the upper right corner (50, 50) from the lower left corner (0,0). There are some random power consumptions from one point to another point. As for the consumption, it depends on the random slope difference. And then we can find the most optimal path with least power consumption.
